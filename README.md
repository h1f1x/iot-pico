# Raspberry Pi Pico W: Getting Started Guide for Software Engineers

Welcome my personal Raspberry Pi Pico W getting started guide for software engineers with little hardware experience. This repository is designed to provide you with the necessary information and resources to begin your journey with the Raspberry Pi Pico W, even if you have limited experience working with hardware.

## Introduction

The Raspberry Pi Pico W is a tiny, low-cost microcontroller board that offers wireless connectivity using the RP2040 chip. It is an excellent choice for software engineers looking to explore the world of embedded systems and IoT projects.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- Raspberry Pi Pico W board
- Micro USB cable
- Computer with a USB port (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

## Getting Started

1. **Set up the development environment:**

   - Install the necessary tools and software for your operating system. You can use either the official Raspberry Pi Pico SDK or the Arduino IDE.
   - For the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK, follow the installation instructions provided in the [official documentation](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf).
   - For the Arduino IDE, install the IDE from the [official website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and add the Raspberry Pi Pico board support package.

2. **Connect the Raspberry Pi Pico W:**

   - Connect the Pico W to your computer using a micro USB cable.
   - The Pico W should be recognized as a USB mass storage device.

3. **Blink the onboard LED:**

   - To test your setup, create a simple program to blink the onboard LED.
   - Use the example code provided in the `examples/blink` directory of this repository as a starting point.
   - Compile and upload the code to your Pico W using the chosen development environment.

4. **Explore wireless connectivity:**

   - The Raspberry Pi Pico W supports wireless connectivity using the onboard Wi-Fi module.
   - Refer to the `examples/wifi` directory for sample code on connecting to a Wi-Fi network and performing basic network operations.

5. **Dive into project ideas:**
   - Explore the `projects` directory in this repository for a collection of beginner-friendly projects that demonstrate various capabilities of the Pico W.
   - Each project includes a detailed README file with step-by-step instructions and explanations.
