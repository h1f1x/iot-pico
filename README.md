# Raspberry Pi Pico W: Getting Started Guide for Software Engineers

Welcome to my personal Raspberry Pi Pico W getting started guide for software engineers with minimal hardware experience. This repository is designed to provide you with the necessary information and resources to begin your journey with the Raspberry Pi Pico W, even if your experience with hardware is limited.

By following this document, you should be able to program the Pico using Python without extensive reading.

## Introduction

The Raspberry Pi Pico W is a tiny, cost-effective microcontroller board that offers wireless connectivity using the RP2040 chip. It is an excellent choice for software engineers looking to explore the world of embedded systems and IoT projects. It is affordable.

### Questions

- Can I mix C code and Python to use some libraries in C?

Additional questions or challenges and their solutions can be found under troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, here is what I have tested this with:

- Raspberry Pi Pico W board
- Micro USB cable
- macOS (M1 with Sohoma 14.4.1 and Monterey 12.7.4)
- Breadboard (optional, but recommended for prototyping)
- Jumper wires (male-to-male, various colors)
- LEDs (various colors)
- Some Resistors (470kÎ© recommended)

I use Homebrew to install additional software.

## Getting Started

### Install IDE and Micropython

Thonny is an excellent all-in-one solution.

```bash
brew install thonny
```

Start Thonny...

I used [Raspberry Pi Pico: Erste Schritte](https://www.elektronik-kompendium.de/sites/raspberry-pi/2612191.htm) ...

Flash (Install) the micropython on the PICO with Thonny. It's n the interpreter config page.

Configure the interpreter for remote execution on the Pico. In my case, it works flawlessly with the auto-detection of the Pico.

### Hardware Projects

I followed some LED and buzzer documentation. Here is my setup on the breadboard:

- PIN 3 (GND) on (-)
- PIN 15, 16, 17 (GP11-13) with a resistor and an LED
- PIN 23 (GND) & PIN 22 (GP16) to a buzzer

Some of the modified code for later reference is in the repository.

For some first ideas about the wiring you can follow: [Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico).

### How to run

Independent code execution. Upload any code as `main.py`. Read: [Power your Raspberry Pi Pico](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico/9)

## Troubleshooting

Problems and errors during the setup are documented here.

### Local Imports in Python
